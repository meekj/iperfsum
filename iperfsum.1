.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIiperfsum\fP prints a per second summary of network activity as seen
in a packet capture file. Output includes Date/Time, Packets, Bytes,
Throughput(kbps), and Re-transmitted packets (only payload carrying packets).

Bytes and throughput are calculated using the frame size which includes the usually present 14 byte Ethernet header.

Re-transmitted packets are counted when data-carrying TCP (only)
packets are seen more than once. Packets are identified with a key
that consists of srcIP-srcPort_dstIP-DstPort:SequenceNumber. The first
packet is not counted, but the final (presumably successfully delivered and ACKed)
re-transmitted packet is counted. Keep this in mind when analyzing
results.

When looking at received data non-zero re-transmitted packet counts suggest that duplicate packets were received.

Header lines are printed before the per second summary and include:
the input file name, filter_expression, TCP client-server-directions seen,
and the capture start date and time. The intention is to use the
headers to label analysis plots and possibly to compare the sender /
reciever file data to be sure that they are for the same iperf test
run.

The primary purpose of the program is to analyze packets captured as
part of an iperf test. The primary downside of using it to look at per
second summary data for general traffic is that the header lines
listing all of the TCP client-server-directions and the packet count for
each could be a very long line if many hosts were
involved. For iperf analysis this would be a single TCP
session-direction.

Optionally, a complete list of the packets is printed (--verbose).

.SH BUGS
.LP
The only time bin width is currently one second. Options for smaller bin sizes should be provided.

IPv6 testing was limited, at least one assumption was made that might fail in the future.

Reading of gzipped packet capture files is not yet supported.

Reading of pcap-ng files is not yet supported.
