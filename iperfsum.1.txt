       _i_p_e_r_f_s_u_m  prints  a per second summary of network activity as seen in a
       packet  capture  file.  Output  includes  Date/Time,  Packets,   Bytes,
       Throughput(kbps),  and  Re-transmitted  packets  (only payload carrying
       packets).

       Bytes and throughput are calculated using the frame size which includes
       the usually present 14 byte Ethernet header.

       Re-transmitted  packets are counted when data-carrying TCP (only) pack-
       ets are seen more than once. Packets are identified  with  a  key  that
       consists   of   srcIP-srcPort_dstIP-DstPort:SequenceNumber.  The  first
       packet is not counted, but the final (presumably successfully delivered
       and  ACKed)  re-transmitted  packet  is counted. Keep this in mind when
       analyzing results.

       When looking at received data  non-zero  re-transmitted  packet  counts
       suggest that duplicate packets were received.

       Header lines are printed before the per second summary and include: the
       input file name, filter_expression, TCP client-server-directions  seen,
       and  the capture start date and time. The intention is to use the head-
       ers to label analysis plots  and  possibly  to  compare  the  sender  /
       reciever  file  data  to  be sure that they are for the same iperf test
       run.

       The primary purpose of the program is to analyze  packets  captured  as
       part  of an iperf test. The primary downside of using it to look at per
       second summary data for general traffic is that the header lines  list-
       ing  all  of  the TCP client-server-directions and the packet count for
       each could be a very long line if many hosts were involved.  For  iperf
       analysis this would be a single TCP session-direction.

       Optionally, a complete list of the packets is printed (--verbose).

       The  only  time  bin width is currently one second. Options for smaller
       bin sizes should be provided.

       IPv6 testing was limited, at least one assumption was made  that  might
       fail in the future.

       Reading of gzipped packet capture files is not yet supported.

       Reading of pcap-ng files is not yet supported.
